# Atlas Reconstruction

This atlas was constructed using T1 and T2 weighted MR images from 204 premature neonates (no preterm babies had visually obvious pathology). The age range at the time of scan was 26.7 to 44.3 weeks post-menstrual age, with mean and standard deviation of 37.3 ± 4.8 weeks (see histogram in Fig. 2). All subjects were born prematurely, with mean age at birth 29.2 ± 2.7, range 24.1 - 35.3 weeks PMA. The images were acquired on 3T Philips Intera system with the following parameters: (1) T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE: TR = 17 ms, TE = 4.6 ms, inversion delay = 1500 ms, flip angle = 13◦, acquisition plane = sagittal, voxel size = 0.82 x 1.03 x 1.6 mm, FOV = 210 x 167 mm and acquired matrix = 256 x 163; (2) T2-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE): TR = 8700 ms, TE = 160 ms, flip angle = 90o, acquisition plane = axial, voxel size = 1.15 x 1.18 x 2 mm, FOV = 220 mm and acquired matrix = 192 x 186.
